# Ray Tracer â€“ Computer Graphics

* Designed texture mapping, constructive solid geometry, refraction/reflection, transparency and anti-
aliasing based on manipulation of matrices and vectors; implemented with C++ and Lua
* Optimised photon mapping with kd-tree for efficient lookup in 3D space and tracing performance using
concurrent programming; boosted performance by around 25% with 3 additional threads
